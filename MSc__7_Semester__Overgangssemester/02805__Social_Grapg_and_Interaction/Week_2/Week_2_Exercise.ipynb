    "Whether a network is sparse does *not* depend on whether each node has “many” connections in absolute terms. It depends on how the number of links $L$ compares to the maximum possible $L\\_{\\max} = \\tfrac{N(N-1)}{2}$.\n",

    "  * The maximum number of possible connections is on the order of $N^2$.\n",
    "  * Each person’s degree $k\\_i$ stays relatively small compared to $N$.\n",
    "  * So $L$ grows like $O(N)$, while $L\\_{\\max}$ grows like $O(N^2)$.\n",
